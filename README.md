Palantir is a discord bot that provides an interactive and social encouraging way to access and manage one's typo account.  
It provides access to all sorts of inventory and its management: sprites, scenes, awards, splits and bubble stats. 

Furthermore, server admins are able to use Palantir to show currently playing users on skribbl in a message in discord.  
Users are able to opt-in for this on the server and palantir will use a channel to modifiy a message continuously with the latest status. 

## ðŸ’€ Performance issues
Palantir has serious performance issues. 
This is for one because the data-hoarding approach of drops in the database is inefficiently handled, but even more because discord rate-limits the continuous editing of the lobby messages.  
There has been a discontinued approach of a re-write (Palantir-Rebirth) and there are plans to split the Commands/Lobby display modules to separate bots, but as this refactor will be extremely time expensive, so there is not ETA on this.
